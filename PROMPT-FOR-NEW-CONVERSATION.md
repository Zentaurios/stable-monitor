I need you to build a Digital Asset Compliance Monitoring MVP for the US Treasury's GENIUS Act response. This is a high-stakes demo that will be viewed by Treasury officials and used for my freelance portfolio.

**Directory**: `/Users/Ryan/builds/stable-monitor`

**Context**: All planning documents are in `/context-for-claude/` - please read them first, especially `00-MASTER-PROMPT.md` for full context.

**Tech Stack (MANDATORY)**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Recharts + Server Actions

**Timeline**: 3-4 hours maximum

**Core Objective**: Demonstrate "innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies" for detecting illicit digital asset activity per Treasury's request.

**Key Features to Build (Priority Order)**:
1. **Real-time transaction monitoring dashboard** with live feed and risk scoring
2. **Interactive network graph** showing wallet connections and entity relationships  
3. **AI/ML demonstration panels** with anomaly detection and risk prediction
4. **Compliance monitoring interface** with alerts and reporting
5. **Identity verification module** with zero-knowledge proof concepts

**Data Strategy**: Try free APIs first (BlockCypher, CoinGecko), fallback to high-quality mocks if needed

**Design Requirements**: Government-ready professional appearance, navy blue color scheme, risk-based color coding (green/yellow/red), mobile responsive

**Deployment**: Must deploy to Vercel for public access

**Success Criteria**: 
- Professional visual impact for Treasury officials
- Working demonstrations of each technology category
- Fast, responsive, interactive experience
- Clear indicators of real vs. simulated data

**START IMMEDIATELY**: Begin with Next.js setup and core dashboard. Focus on impressive visuals and functionality over perfect implementation. This needs to showcase innovative compliance technologies that solve Treasury's digital asset monitoring challenges.

Read the planning docs in `/context-for-claude/` then start building the project structure and core dashboard components.
