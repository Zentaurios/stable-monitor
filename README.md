## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
# Optional: API keys for real data sources
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCYPHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## üìä Data Strategy

The application uses a hybrid approach:

1. **Mock Data**: High-quality simulated data for reliable demo experience
2. **Real API Integration**: Ready for BlockCypher, CoinGecko, and other APIs
3. **Live Simulation**: Real-time updates to demonstrate system capabilities

## üé® Design Principles

- **Government-Ready**: Professional, trustworthy appearance
- **Navy Blue Color Scheme**: Official government aesthetic
- **Risk-Based Color Coding**: Green/Yellow/Orange/Red system
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality across devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant design patterns

## üöÄ Deployment to Vercel

### Quick Deploy

1. **Connect to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npx vercel
   ```

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add any API keys in Vercel dashboard
   - No environment variables required for demo functionality

### Manual Deployment

1. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
